# CHIP-8 interpreter.
An interpreter that helped me to enter the world of emulation (and to stay sane in quarantine), made in C ++ 17.

## Snapshots.



## Experimental branch.
There is an experimental branch in which the assembly code is generated at compile time via _template metaprogramming_, for this you need to hardcode the ROM files (i know, kinda messy).
